    "Although the revenue that a movie eventually earns depends on many different factors, it directly depends on how many tickets it can sell.<br>\n",

    "Based on this, our first assumption is that a movie earns more if it is released during the leisure months of its targeted audiences. Thus, it will be more legitimate to compare movies within the same genre. We will be focusing on specific genre(s) when analyzing our data.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Our second hypothesis, which follows the first, is that the revenue is also influenced by the release time relative to other events. Since people's money and time are limited, if the movie is released when there are other events (major social/entertainment events, or other popular movies) coming, people who originally plan to watch the movie may give up on it.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The qualities of movies could be a potential confounding factor here, since it is natural for people to not watch movies that are rated badly. We will compare movies that are roughly at the same level, measuring primarily by the ratings."
